The assignment:

Pull the files from the master branch into your local repository.
Write a program that reads in the table of Hexidecimal numbers and
converts them to decimal numbers and then saves that to a file called
"dec_table.txt"

Create a branch in your local repository (Bellagio terminal) that has your name
in it. Example "pristas-branch". Do all your work in this branch and when
complete push the files to a new remote branch with the same name.

Use the"git add" command to have git start to track it. You can also use the
"git commit" to store a snapshot of the code. You will need to commit all changes
before pushing it to the remote branch.

You will be able to see other branches and can add comments or "issues" as a way
to discuss. You will be able to pull others code from their remote branch to use
if you like.

I will merge the final code into the master when it is agreed by all.
